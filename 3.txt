These routines write the characters of the (null-terminated) character string str
on the given window. It is similar to calling waddch once for each character in the string. 
The four routines with n as the last argument write at most n characters. 
If n is -1, then the entire string will be added, up to the maximum number of 
characters that will fit on the line, or until a terminating null is reached.
